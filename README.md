# My HTML and CSS Projects

This is a few sample web designs that I have made:
<ul>
<li>[The Space Station](https://github.com/bohdilong/html_and_css_projects/tree/main/Project)</li>
<li>[Academy Cinema](https://github.com/bohdilong/html_and_css_projects/tree/main/bootstrap4_project)</li>
</ul>

## The Space Station

This project is an example of a space resort. It is styled using css. It contains items such as a navbar, image containers, and form

## Academy Cinema

This project is an example of a home page of a movie theater. It is styled using Bootstrap4 components that include but are not limited to a navbar,
jumbotron, a form, cards, and dropdown.
